/**
 * Send this event to a structure template entity to start the spawning of the structure.
 *
 * Each handler should do the following:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>It must send at the start a {@link StructureSpawnStartedEvent}. Other event handlers might use it to trigger
 *     stuff. E.g. handlers of {@link StructureSpawnStartedEvent} might display soem particles or play a round
 *     when a certain component is present.</li>
 *     <li>It may place the blocks instantly or delayed. Possibly triggering a nice animation.
 *     To get the blocks to place it can send a {@link GetStructureTemplateBlocksEvent}.
 *     Alternativly it can also send a {@link SpawnBlocksOfStructureTemplateEvent} event to trigger
 *     the default block spawning</li>
 *     <li>After all blocks have been spawned it must send a {@link StructureBlocksSpawnedEvent}.
 *     The {@link StructureBlocksSpawnedEvent} triggers further structure finish up work like the placement of items
 *     in a chest.</li>
 *     <li>It must consume the event.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * If you don't want to add a new block placement animation then you should not implement a handler for this event.
 * If you want to create a component that triggers the spawning of for example some entities then you should
 * create a handler for {@link StructureBlocksSpawnedEvent} instead.
