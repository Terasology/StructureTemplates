/**
 * Only used as marker component to allow the search for prefabs that describe structure template types.
 *
 * Structure template type prefabs get referenced by {@link ScheduleStructurePlacementComponent}s and
 * {@link StructureTemplateComponent}s. Via this reference a link between the 2 is created.
 *
 * The prefab with the {@link StructureTemplateComponent} describes the structure type that the entity with
 * {@link StructureTemplateComponent} must devliper and that the component {@link ScheduleStructurePlacementComponent}
 * can exspect. So prefabs with {@link StructureTemplateTypeComponent}s are acting like a interface constract.
 *
 * Prefabs with the {@link StructureTemplateTypeComponent} should also have a {@link DisplayNameComponent} so
 * that they can be listed with proper name and description in editor UIs.
